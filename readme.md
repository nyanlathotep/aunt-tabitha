### Aunt Tabitha

is a data pre-processor for a schedule display. The format it takes in is highly dependent on specific settings from a particular Excel plugin, and it is highly application-specific.

### Setup

It can be freshly installed and run as-is with python 2.7 (known working with 2.7.6; it has no dependencies outside the standard library). The batch files added for convenience, however, depend on python being installed next to them, in the folder py27 (i.e. python would be located in aunt-tabitha/py27/python.exe). This is a historical relic of its use case, and the batch files can be readily modified to use a different python instance if needed.
